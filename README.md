## Canoe Trainer

This project was developed to control the training of athletes. A device has been implemented that shows how far it is from the location, how fast it travels, how much heart rate data is received with the BLE protocol, average, instantaneous speeds and how many minutes it has been training. It automatically saves the training data to the SD card.
